<h1>Amusement Park</h1>
<p>Today, my fabulous camp group went to (an) {{ session ['4AJECTIVE'] }} amusement park. It was a fun park with lots of cool play structures. When we got there, my kind counselor, {{ session ['1FRIENDSNAME'] }}, shouted loudly, "Everybody off the {{ session ['11NOUN'] }}!" We all pushed out in a terrible hurry. My counselor handed out yellow tickets, and we scurried in. I was so excited! I couldn't figure out what exciting thing to do first. I saw a scary roller coaster I really liked so, I {{ session ['15VERB'] }} over to get in the long line that had about {{ session ['2NUMBER'] }} people in it. When I finally got on the roller coaster I was {{ session ['12PASTTENSEVERB'] }}. In fact I was so nervous my two knees were knocking together. This was the most {{ session ['5AJECTIVE'] }} ride I had ever been on! In about two minutes I heard the crank and grinding of the gears. Thatâ€™s when the ride began! When I got to the bottom, I was a little {{ session ['12PASTTENSEVERB'] }} but I was proud of myself. It was a(n) {{ session ['10AJECTIVE'] }} day at the fun park.</p>
