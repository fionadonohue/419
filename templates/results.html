<p>Last month, I went to Disney World with {{ session['1FRIENDSNAME'] }}. We traveled for {{ session['2NUMBER'] }} hours by {{ session['3VEHICLE'] }}. Finally, we
arrived and it was very {{ session['4AJECTIVE'] }}. There were {{ session['5AJECTIVE'] }} people {{ session['6INGVERB'] }} everywhere. There
were also people dressed up in {{ session['7ANIMAL'] }} costumes.
I wish it had been more {{ session['8AJECTIVE'] }}, but we {{ session['9PASTTENSEVERB'] }} anyway. We also went on a(n) {{ session['10AJECTIVE'] }} ride
called Magic {{ session['11NOUN'] }}. {{ session['1FRIENDSNAME'] }} nearly fell off a ride and had to be {{ session['12PASTTENSEVERB'] }}. Later, we went to the hotel and
{{ session['13PASTTENSEVERB'] }}. Next year, I want to go to {{ session['14PLACE'] }}, where we can {{ session['15VERB'] }}. </p>
